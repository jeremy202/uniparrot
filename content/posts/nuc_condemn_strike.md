As the recent Asuu strike clocks 6 months, the National University commission has totally condemned the process as it doesn't only affects universities, but in extention affects the national economy. 

At the opening session of the 2022 management retreat with vice chancellors of Nigerian universities, organised by the commission which held on Monday, the Executive Secretary of NUC, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed took the initiative to speak against the strike. 

Rasheed said NUC was determined to promote dialogue and constructive engagement with critical stakeholders to see a crisis-free university system.

“The NUC sympathizes with the vice chancellors, we know how difficult the task of being a VC is ,nobody is happy with the VC of a university ,students are not happy that the VC cannot provide electricity, lecturers are also not happy because their pockets are low even the communities as well, the vice chancellors face serious challenges and road blocks to achieve the success of their mandates” Prof Rasheed said.

Finally the Prof  made it known that no country ever made it without Education. As Education was a very vital tool in creation of goals, innovations etc. Which was the major force for nation building.
